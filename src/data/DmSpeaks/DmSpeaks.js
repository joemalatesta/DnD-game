    <p>You wake up, head full of fuzz, not quite sure what happened last night. The sky is still dark with a slight glimmer of the coming dawn.  </p> 
    <p>You look around to find yourself lying on a stone pathway just outside a city entrance gate. As you look around you notice a small note on the ground next to you. The note, you notice, is a Map! This doesn't look like any area you remember. On the back of this map is scribbled this note. </p>
    <p>"As payment for your unruly behavior and public drunkeness, you are hereby ordered to light the signal pyres on the mountain to the east. You have 2 weeks to get this completed."</p></div> },{text:`You Need to roll the die`},
