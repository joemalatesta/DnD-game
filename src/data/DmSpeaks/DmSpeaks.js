    You wake up head full of fuzz. Not quite sure what happened last night you look around to find yourself lying on a stone pathway just outside a city entrance gate. The sky is still dark with a slight glimmer of the coming dawn. As you look around you notice a small note on the ground next to you. as you look at the note you notice that it is a Map!
